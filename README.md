# Autogui

This is a wrapper around the classic [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package from Python. 

Most of the functions have been wrapped over to provide native Julia code and multiple dispatch. Some extra functionality regarding pauses and intervals have also been added. The documentation can be found at the above link and everything is same as the Python version. 

This package is more of a convinence right now but the plan is to make it native Julia very soon. I did not find any such package and not many people know of PyAutoGUI so I decided to port it.

PRs welcome if you can help me out!! It is just in its infancy right now.
